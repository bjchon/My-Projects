/* Title: Demo code for CSE 031 Lecture 08 (Fall 2021)
 * Author: Santosh Chandrasekhar
 * 
 *
 * Instructions:
 * Compile the code. Let's assume this outputs the executable file named a.out. Next, 
 * execute the command "size a.out" at your command prompt (assuming a linux shell).
 * Observe the values of text (code segment), data (global and static variables that 
 * are initialized), and bss (global and static variables that are not initialized). 
 * They represent the decimal size of these segments in bytes. dec = text + data + bss,
 * and hex shows dec in hexadecimal format. The bss and data put together is the static 
 * data segment in lecture slides. 

 * Now, uncomment a line starting with the declaration of the uninitialized global variable
 * x, recompile the code and run the size command to see how the text, data and bss 
 * values change. Follow this process for all the other commented lines.
