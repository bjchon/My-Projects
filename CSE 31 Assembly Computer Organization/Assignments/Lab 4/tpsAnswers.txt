TPS activity 1:

1) 2
2) four_ints doesn't change
3) my answer is different from 2
4) it prints 2 and I am surprised and lost
5) a)1, four_ints[4]
   b) yes, they both point to the same base address, 
     four_c = (char*)four_ints (this statement casts an int pointer to a char pointer.)
   c) They print the same hex just inverted because LIFO.
6) the consecutive address locations differ by 4 because each array location is 4 bytes
7) 
8) the consecutive address location differ by 1 because each char location is 1 byte
9)
10) Depending on the pointer type it will access memory in different ways. When the 
char pointer is incremented the the memory location is incremented by 1. 
When the array pointer is incremented the array memory location is incremented by 4

TPS activity 2:

1) It allocates space off the heap to store a pointer of a pointer to an int.
2) use a for loop: for(i = 0; i < n; ++n)
3) *(*(arr+i) + j) = 0;
4) the size is needed to determine the number of rows and columns
5) 
6)
7)
