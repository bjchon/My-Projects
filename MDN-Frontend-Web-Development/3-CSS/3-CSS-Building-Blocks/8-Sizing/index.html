    <!--Task1
    In this task, you have two boxes. The first should be sized so that 
    the height will be at least 100 pixels tall, even if there is less 
    content that would cause it to grow to that height. However, the 
    content should not overflow if there is more content than fits in 
    100 pixels. Test this box by removing the content from the HTML to 
    make sure you still get a 100 pixel tall box even with no content.

    The second box should be fixed at 100 pixels tall, so that content 
    will overflow if there is too much.

    <!--Task2
        In this task, you have a box, which contains another box. Your 
        task is to make the inner box 60% of the width of the outer box. 
        The value of the box-sizing property is set to border-box, which 
        means that the total width includes any padding and border. You 
        should also give the inner box padding of 10% using the width 
        (or inline size) as the size from which that percentage is 
        calculated.

        <div class="inner">Make me 60% of my parent's width.</div>
    </div>

    <!--Task3
        In this task, you have two images in boxes. One image is smaller 
        than the box, the other is larger and breaking out of the box. 
        If you imagine that the box is responsive and therefore could grow
         and shrink, which property would you apply to the image so that 
         the large image shrinks down into the box but the small image 
         does not stretch.
