# heuristic.py
#
# This script defines a utility class that can be used as an implementation
# of a frontier state (location) evaluation function for use in route-finding
# heuristic search algorithms. When a HeuristicSearch object is created,
# initialization code can be executed to prepare for the use of the heuristic
# during search. In particular, a RouteProblem object is typically provided 
# when the HeuristicFunction is created, providing information potentially
# useful for initialization. The actual heuristic cost function, simply
# called "h_cost", takes a state (location) as an argument.
#
# I used the pseudocode from our textbook and lecture slides
# I also used this website https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp
